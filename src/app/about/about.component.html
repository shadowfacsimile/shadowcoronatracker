    <div class="about-question">
        Why YACT?
    </div>
    <div class="about-answer">
        Most of the COVID-19 trackers I was following were either filled with ads or were information heavy. I wanted a
        tracker that gave me just enough information about COVID-19 without ads. Hence YACT.
